Magento -> Robin the creation of a Customer Service Plugin

# Setup

## 1. Development environment

This example code is all developed with the use of a Vagrant box. If you want to develop you own implementation based on this code, I strongly recommend to use a Vagrant box as a development environment as the setup is quick and easy. If you are new to Vagrant, please watch [this][magento-vagrant] little presentation to get you up to speed
